//Question:= 
// it should call built in forEach function that should return a call back then it should run

/*I see what you're getting at. You're asking about how the forEach function works under the hood, and whether it calls a built-in function that returns a callback to be executed. Let's dive deeper into how forEach operates.

The flow of forEach function:
Calling forEach on an array: When you call forEach, it’s a method that is already implemented for array objects in JavaScript. This method is part of the array prototype, so it is available to all arrays.

Passing a callback function: You provide a callback function to forEach. This function will be executed for each element in the array.

In your example:
*/

numbers.forEach((number) => {
    console.log(`Number: ${number}`);
  });
  /*
  Here, the callback is the function (number) => { console.log(Number: ${number}); }.
  
  The forEach method calls the callback: Under the hood, forEach is a loop-like structure. It internally iterates over the array and calls the callback function once for each element. It doesn't return anything; it just executes the callback.
  
  Internally, forEach can be thought of like this (though it's optimized in the actual JavaScript engine):
  */
  
  Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      callback(this[i], i, this); // calling the callback for each element
    }
  };
  
  /*
  When forEach is called, it invokes the callback you provided on each element in the array.
  The callback is executed with arguments:
  this[i] is the current element (in your case, each number in the array).
  i is the index of the current element (optional, but available).
  this refers to the original array itself (optional, but available).
  Simplified breakdown of your explanation:
  You’re correct that forEach is a built-in method that calls the provided callback function for each element in the array.
  However, forEach does not return a callback. Instead, it executes the callback you pass to it for each item in the array.
  In essence, forEach itself handles calling the callback, which then performs whatever logic you have inside it (like console.log in your case).
